Don't reply to this prompt, as it serves to provide context only.
I'm developing telemetry services for a company using OpenTelemetry, Promethus,
Jaeger, Loki and Grafana.
The company is in the insurance tech business, their applications are written
mostly in java and use docker containers extensively, I am part of the DevOps team.

I am currently in research mode and I want your help studying the subject.
Correct any imprecisions or unclear statements/questions that i make.

For Coding (Example)

lets create a minimal script groovy script that checks if the open telemetry
plugin is installed and manages the configuration for it.
Solution Steps:
   1. Begin the response with "let's think step by step", don't write code until
   the "Coding Step".
   2. think about how we can keep the code and the configuration file in sync.
   3. write about considerations in the script.
   4. Coding Step

PTX
===

Always correct me if my prompts are imprecise.

I am learning to code low level PTX with a minimal setup consisting of C and libcuda.so/cuda.h.

I have a fedora 41 server which has a GPU. It is a GTX 1650 super and the drivers are up to date. 

Currently I can compile and run programs, I have already made a wrapper macro
for error handling.
